\textbf{Figures S15. Alignment of Eucoilini+Trichoplastini EVEs along with Filamentous virus genes}. All plots obtained using the msa R package. TryEFV: \textit{Trybliographa} Endogenous Filamentous Elements (EFV),  \textit{TrEFV} : \textit{Trichoplasta} EFV, RhEFV : \textit{Rhoptromeris} EFV, LhEFV : Leptopilina heterotoma EFV, LcEFV : Leptopilina clavipes EFV, LbEFV : Leptopilina boulardi EFV, LhFV : Leptopilina heterotoma FV (FV), LbFV : Leptopilina boulardi FV, EfFV : Encarsia formosa FV, PcFV : Psyttalia concolor FV, PoFV : Platygaster orseoliae FV, CcFV1 and CcFV2 : Cotesia congregata FV 1 and 2.\\
\textbf{Figures S16. Individual gene phylogenies of EVEs found in Eucoilini+Trichoplastini wasp species.} Phylogenies include sequences from free-living viruses in red and sequences from parasitic wasps in blue. The phylogeny type is indicated in the left corner of each figure (see Fig. S5 for type information). EVEs belonging to species in the Eucoilini+Trichoplastini tribe are shown in light blue, while the other known EVEs are shown in pale blue. Sequences found in eukaryote and bacterial genomes are shown in green and black, respectively. Confidence scores (aLRT\%/ultra-bootstrap support\%) are shown at each node.\\
